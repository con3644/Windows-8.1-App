# Windows-8.1-App
WPF C# code-behind for an app I am developing. This is part of a program for rhythmic dictation (what musicians use practice their craft). This will eventually take a tempo and number of measures (chosen by the musician), and determine the proper msPerBeat and msPerMeasure (milliseconds for each value, used to evaluate which notes fit the current measure). The milliseconds determine which note will be played from a file and build a set of measures of randomly generated notes.
