# Windows-8.1-App
WPF C# code-behind for an app I developed. This is part of a program for rhythmic dictation (what musicians use to practice their craft). The program take a tempo and number of measures, and determines the proper msPerBeat and msPerMeasure (milliseconds for each value, used to evaluate which notes fit the current measure). The milliseconds determine which note will be played from a file and build a set of measures of randomly generated notes.
The user then must guess the notes that were played. The guess is compared to what was actually played. If correct, the program congratulates the user. If not, he or she may try again or start a different randomized set.
