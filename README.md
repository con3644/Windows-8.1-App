# Windows-8.1-App
WPF C# XAML and code-behind for an app I developed. This is part of a program for rhythmic dictation (what musicians use to practice their craft). The program take a tempo and number of measures, and determines the proper msPerBeat and msPerMeasure (milliseconds for each value, used to evaluate which notes fit the current measure). The milliseconds determine which note will be played from a file and build a set of measures of randomly generated notes. Until further development, the tempo and measures are set by the program. The user then must guess the notes that were played.
